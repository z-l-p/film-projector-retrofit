##This is a development platform to support the [Wandering 16mm Projector Retrofit WIKI](https://www.filmlabs.org/wiki/en/meetings_projects/spectral/mire-wandering/wandering-16mmprojection/start) on filmlabs.org. Go there for complete documentation.

----

**Make a 16mm film projector portable and playable like an instrument. Retrofit with a DC motor and LED lamp, controlled by ESP32 micro-controller.**
This project is part of [SPECTRAL Wandering Sounds and Images Seminar](https://www.mire-exp.org/evenement/spectral-wandering-sound-and-images/) in Nantes FR in 2023/2024, enabling film projection performances that explore itinerancy, nomadism, and adaptation to multiple environments.
